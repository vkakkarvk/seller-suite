# Deployment Options Comparison for SellerSuite

## What is Inactivity Timeout?

**Inactivity Timeout** = When no one uses your app for a certain period, the hosting service puts it to "sleep" to save resources.

- ‚úÖ **Good**: You don't pay for idle resources
- ‚ùå **Bad**: First visitor after "sleep" waits 30-60 seconds for the app to wake up
- ‚ö° **After wake**: App works normally for next users
